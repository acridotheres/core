# Acridotheres Core Library

The Acridotheres Core Library (ACL) is the backend library for Acridotheres and its CLI.

The library is fully written in Rust and is designed to be fast and efficient. It includes all the shared functionality between the CLI and the main application like compression, file system handling, and format handling.

> [!NOTE]
> This library should only be used by the Acridotheres CLI and the main application.
> We are not responsible for any issues that may arise from using this library in your own projects.

This library is still in development and is not yet ready for use.

---

Please only report issues that are related to the library itself and not the CLI or the main application:

**What you should report:**

- Compression issues
- Format handling issues
- File system issues
- Any other issues that are related to the library

**What you should not report:**

- UI issues like glitches or crashes
- CLI issues

Acridotheres and its CLI will show you where the issue is coming from, so please report it to the correct repository:

- Library errors will be shown as `ERR:CORE`
- CLI errors will be shown as `ERR:CLI`
- Main application errors will be shown as `ERR:GUI`

Both the CLI and the main application have their own repositories where you can report issues related to them.
